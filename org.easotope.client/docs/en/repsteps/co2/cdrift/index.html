	  <title>Î´<sup>13</sup>C Drift Correction</title>
	</meta>
  </head>

  <body>
  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

	<p>Mass spectrometer measurements often drift slightly over time. This 
	drift can be corrected by intermittently measuring known standard values and
	then removing the observed drift in the standard values from the measured
	values. This step performs this correction.</p>

  	<h2>Parameters</h2>

  	<p>A collection of standard replicates is needed to do this step. The user
  	may choose to select all standard replicates from the correction interval
  	or only those in a user specified window around the sample replicate. If a window
  	is chosen, the number of standard replicates that will be used before and after
  	the sample replicate must be entered. Standard types that are considered valid
  	for this correction must also be indicated.</p>

  	<p>In addition, the user can also specify that stretching should be used for
  	this correction. Stretching allows the amount of correction to vary proportionally
  	with the expected value and often gives better results.</p>

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>

	<p>When doing drift correction without stretching, this step collects all the
	valid standard measurements in the specified range and subtracts their measured
	value from their expected value. These differences are then averaged together
	and this average is added to the sample value being corrected.</p>

	<p>If stretching is turned on then a linear regression is made from measured
	and expected values of the valid standards in the specified range. It's now assumed
	that the expected value of our sample should fall on this line. By solving
	the linear equation for the measured sample value, we obtain its expected value.</p>

	<p>Note that stretching requires that more than one standard type be available
	in the specified window in order to generate a linear regression. If this is not
	the case, this step will instead use the non-stretching algorithm until more
	standards are added.</p>
