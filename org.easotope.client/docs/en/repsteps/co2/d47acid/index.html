	  <title>Δ47 Acid Fractionation</title>
	</meta>

  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>When acid is used to release CO<sub>2</sub> from minerals such as calcite
  	or aragonite, the resulting Δ47 value is off relative to the original mineral and
  	needs to be corrected.</p>

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>

  	<p>This correction step uses the acid temperature given by the user during
  	data entry to find the Δ47 acid fractionation factor (AFF) for the sample type.
  	This value is then simply added to the input Δ47 value.
