  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>So that calculated Δ48 values can be compared against values from other labs,
  	a standard CDES scale was created. This step maps a measured sample Δ48 onto this
  	scale.</p>

 	<h2>Parameters</h2>

 	<p>Because acid temperature affects the Δ48 measurements, only standard replicates
 	made with the same acid temperature can be used to build the CDES scale. This
 	means the acid temperature must be entered as a parameter.</p>
 
  	<p>A collection of standard replicates is needed to do this step. The user
  	may choose to select all standard replicates from the correction interval
  	or only those in a user specified window around the sample replicate. If a window
  	is chosen, the number of standard replicates that will be used before and after
  	the sample replicate must be entered. Standard types that are considered valid
  	for this correction must also be indicated.</p>

  	<p>The original algorithm (Dennis et al) for calculating an ETF called for
  	averaging the Δ48 values for each standard individually. These averages were
  	then used to build the ETF regression. This is not Easotope's default algorithm.
  	However, it can be optionally turned on.</p>

	<h2>Algorithm</h2>

	<p>The default algorithm is to collect all the appropriate standard replicates
	and use the measured Δ48 and known Δ48 CDES values to build a regression.
	Measured Δ48 values from samples can then be projected into the Δ48 CDES scale
	by solving this linear equation.</p>

	<p>If averaging is turned on, then for each standard, an average Δ48 of all of
	that standard's replicates is first calculated. This results in the same
	number of points in the ETF regression as there are selected standards. Because
	this averaging "blurs" the data that is fed into the regression, the weights
	of the original data can cause the regression to shift slightly from the
	default algorithm.</p>
