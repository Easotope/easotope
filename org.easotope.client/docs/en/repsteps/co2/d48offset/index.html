  	<h2>Purpose</h2>
 
  	<p>The Δ48 correction and average offset can be used to identify contamination
  	in sample replicates.</p>

	<h2>Parameters</h2>

  	<p>A collection of standard replicates is needed to do this step. The
  	user may choose to select all standard replicates from the correction interval
  	or only those in a user specified window around the sample replicate. If a window
  	is chosen, the number of standard replicates that will be used before and after
  	the sample replicate must be entered.</p>

	<p>The standard types that are to be used for this correction must also
	be indicated. This is done by assigning the valid standards to "groups" where
	a group is simply a number. The number 0 indicates that the standard is not
	in a group and should not be used in this correction. Multiple standards might be
	in the same group. For example, two standards might be expected to fall on the
	same line in a Δ48 vs δ48 graph and could, therefore, be put in the same group.</p>

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>

	<p>The measured Δ48 and δ48 values are taken from all the valid standard
 	replicates in the specified range. Each group of standards becomes one line in
 	a multi-line regression. The regression calculates a single slope to best match
 	all these lines. The correction for the sample is then calculated as:</p>
 
  	<p>correction = -δ48 * regression_slope</p>
 
  	<p>And the Δ48 average offset for the sample averages the following value
  	for all the lines:<p>
 
  	<p>offset = Δ48 - regression_intercept</p>
