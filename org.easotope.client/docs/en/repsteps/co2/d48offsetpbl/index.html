  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>Because the Δ48 signal should generally be low in natural samples, observing
  	large deviations in this value can indicate contamination in a sample replicate.
  	This step calculates a Δ48 offset value as a means of easily identifying such
  	contamination.
 
  	<h2>Parameters</h2>
  	
  	<p>A collection of standard replicates is needed to do this step. The user
  	may choose to select all standard replicates from the correction interval
  	or only those in a user specified window around the sample replicate. If a window
  	is chosen, the number of standard replicates that will be used before and after
  	the sample replicate must be entered. Standard types that are considered valid
  	for this correction must also be indicated.</p>
  	
  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>
 
  	<p>All non-disabled standard replictes within the indicated range are collected.
  	Their Δ48 values are averaged together and this average is subtracted from the
  	sample Δ48 value to create the Δ48 offset.
