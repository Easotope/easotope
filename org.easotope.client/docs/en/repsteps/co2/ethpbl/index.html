  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>Mass spectrometer measurements are made relative to a background value that
  	is always present in the machine. This background value needs to be subtracted
  	from the measured value for each m/z in order to get the actual value. However,
  	some mass spectrometers do not calculate a background value that is precise
  	enough for analyses such as clumped isotopes. This step allows a user-selected
  	background to be used in place of the background value normally used by the mass
  	spectrometer. The user specifies these background values by selecting an average
  	background region in the scan editor.

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>
 
 	<p>The algorithm used by this step is described in
 	<a href="http://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.6490" title="http://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.6490">Bernasconi et al, 2013</a>
 	and is summarized below.</p>

 	<p>When scan files are imported into Easotope, for each m/z cup the user has
 	the option of selecting a region that they believe best represents the
 	background value for that cup. Since multiple, simultaneous scans are made with
 	different acceleration voltages, this region can be used to calculate an average
 	off-peak measurement for each acceleration voltages and use these points to generate a
 	linear regression. The result is one regression per m/z that can later be used to
 	interpolate backgrounds for other measurements.</p>
 
    <p>This step first adds the background value that was previously subtracted by
    the mass spectrometer. This returns the voltages to pure measurements. If no
    background is present, voltages are simply copied.</p>

    <p>Then it finds the most recent (past) scan files that were added to Easotope
    and obtains the regression for each m/z. This regression is then used to
    interpolate a new background by using the intensity of the 44 beam and this new
    background value is subtracted from the voltages. In this last step, the voltages
    are adjusted separately for sample measureuments and reference gas measurements.
    In each case, the 44 beam of the sample or reference gas are used, respectively.</p>
