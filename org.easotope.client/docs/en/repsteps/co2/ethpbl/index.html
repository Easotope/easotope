  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>Mass spectrometer measurements are made relative to a background value that
  	is always present in the machine. This background value needs to be subtracted
  	from the measured value for each m/z in order to get the actual value. However,
  	some mass spectrometers do not calculate a background value that is precise
  	enough for analyses such as clumped isotopes.</p>
  	
  	<p>This step allows a user-selected background to be used in place of the background
  	value normally used by the mass spectrometer. The user specifies these background
  	values by selecting one of three algorithms when processing the scan files:</p>
  	
    <ul>
      <li class="level1">
        <div class="li">No correction.</div>
      </li>
      <li class="level1">
        <div class="li">Correction based on a reference cup and a regression built from a selected region as described in <a href="http://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.6490" title="http://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.6490">Bernasconi et al, 2013</a></div>
      </li>
      <li class="level1">
        <div class="li">Correction based on a half-cup measurement multiplied by a scaling factor.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Parameters</h2>

    <p>In the parameters tab, the user can select whether:</p>
   
    <ul>
      <li class="level1">
        <div class="li">only the nearest scan file should be used for correction,</div>
      </li>
      <li class="level1">
        <div class="li">an interpolation should be done using the two scan files surrounding the replicate being corrected,</div>
      </li>
      <li class="level1">
        <div class="li">a moving window of scan files should be used for correction.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In case a window is selected the user may should how large the window should be.</p>

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>
  
    <p>This step first adds the background value that was previously subtracted by
    the mass spectrometer. Doing so returns the voltages to pure measurements. If no
    background is present, voltages are simply copied.</p>

    <p>Then this step finds all the scan files that apply to this correction, as
    indicated by the parameter settings. It uses each of these scan files to calculate
    a background value and then interpolates appropriately among the scan files. The
    resulting background value is then used to correct the raw voltages again.</p>
