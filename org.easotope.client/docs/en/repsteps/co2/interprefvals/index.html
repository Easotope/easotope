    <h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>Each sample measurement needs to be compared to a reference gas measurement,
  	but both gases cannot be measured at the same time. To get around this problem,
  	various algorithms are used to generate artificial reference gas measurements
  	that are close to the value that would be measured, were the reference gas to
  	be measured at the same time as the sample measurement. This step implements two
  	of these algorithms: dual inlet averaging and LIDI2.
  	</p>

	<h2>Parameters</h2>

	<p>In dual inlet averaging, reference measurements before and after the sample
	measurement are averaged together. This step has a parameter which determines
	whether averaging should be done only if both the before and after value exist
	or whether it is sufficient for only one to exist (the other might be disabled,
	for example).</p>

	<h2>Algorithm</h2>
	
    <p>
	Two algorithms are implemented in this step: dual inlet averaging and LIDI2.
	Which is executed is determined by the type of the data file being processed.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If the file is a standard dual inlet file, then reference measurements before
	and after each sample measurement are averaged together to create an artificial
	reference measurement for that sample measurement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If the file is a LIDI2 file, a series of samples measurements is both proceeded
    by and followed by a series of reference measurements. Each of these reference
    series are used to generate a best-fit quadratic equation from which an average
    quadratic equation is generated. Individual reference measurements are then
    generated by sampling the average quadratic equation at each point corresponding
    to a sample measurement.
