	  <title>Δ47 Nonlinearity Correction</title>
	</meta>

	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>Before pressure baseline (PBL) corrections were developed, a slope was
  	observed in the Δ47 vs δ47 graph whereas a straight, horizontal line would
  	normally be expected. This step uses standard measurements and a range of
  	Δ47 and δ47 values to figure out the slope of this error and correct for it.</p>

  	<h2>Parameters</h2>
 
  	<p>A collection of standard replicates is needed to do this step. The
  	user may choose to select all standard replicates from the correction interval
  	or only those in a user specified window around the sample replicate. If a window
  	is chosen, the number of standard replicates that will be used before and after
  	the sample replicate must be entered.</p>

	<p>The standard types that are to be used for this correction must also
	be indicated. This is done by assigning the valid standards to "groups" where
	a group is simply a number. The number 0 indicates that the standard is not
	in a group and should not be used in this correction. Multiple standards might be
	in the same group. For example, two standards might be expected to fall on the
	same line in a Δ47 vs δ47 graph and could, therefore, be put in the same group.</p>

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>
 
 	<p>The measured Δ47 and δ47 values are taken from all the valid standard
 	replicates in the specified range. Each group of standards becomes one line in
 	a multi-line regression. The regression calculates a single slope to best match
 	all these lines. The sample's Δ47 vs δ47 point is then projected up or down
 	the slope of this regression to find a Δ47 intercept which is assumed to represent
 	the true Δ47 after this error is removed.</p>
