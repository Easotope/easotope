	  <title>δ<sup>18</sup>O Acid Fractionation</title>
	</meta>

  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>When acid is used to release CO<sub>2</sub> from minerals such as calcite
  	or aragonite, the resulting CO<sub>2</sub> has a δ<sup>18</sup>O that is enriched
  	relative to the original mineral. The amount of enrichment depends on the temperature
  	of the acid used. This step corrects the δ<sup>18</sup>O value to account for the
  	enrichment.</p>
  	
  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>
 
  	<p>This correction step uses the acid temperature given by the user
  	during data entry to find the δ<sup>18</sup>O acid fractionation factor (AFF) for
  	the sample type. It then uses this AFF to calculate a corrected δ<sup>18</sup>O
  	which represents the expected δ<sup>18</sup>O of the original mineral using the
  	following formula:</p>

	<p>acid_corrected_value = ((1000.0 + original_value) / AFF) - 1000.0</p>

	<p>Note that if no acid correction is necessary (for example, when measuring
	atmospheric gas) the AFF can be set to 1.0 for that sample type and no
	correction will be made.</p>

	<p>This correction step also copies the acid temperature and acid fractionation
	factor from the replicate database into the table.</p>
