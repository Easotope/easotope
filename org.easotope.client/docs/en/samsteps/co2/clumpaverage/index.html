  	<h2>Purpose</h2>

  	<p>Important clumped CO<sub>2</sub> values from the underlying replicates need to
  	be averaged together for a sample-level summary.</p>

  	<h2>Algorithm</h2>

  	<p>This step is applied to the Î”47 values. The mean, standard deviation, and the
  	standard error are computed for this value. Note that this step ignores
  	the standard deviation and standard error values that were computed at the
  	replicate level.</p>
