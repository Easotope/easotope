<h2><a name="1.0">1.0 System Requirements</a></h2>

<h3><a name="1.1">1.1 Disk Space</a></h3>

<h4><a name="1.1.1">1.1.1 Database Disk Size</a></h4>

Easotope creates an archive of raw data files (generated by a mass spectrometer) that will
grow over time. As a very rough estimate, expect more than 2 Gigabytes of files per mass
spectrometer per year. But since disk space is cheap, it is recommended that your disks
be much, much larger to allow for future added functionality.

<h4><a name="1.1.2">1.1.2 Backup Disk Size</a></h4>

Easotope has a built-in automatic backup system. If this feature is turned-on in the
<i>args.properties</i> file, the server will make a zip file of the entire database at a configured
time and put this zip file in a separate backup directory. It is highly recommended that
this second directory be on a different physical disk from the main database in order to
protected against single disk failures. This second disk needs to be approximately 5 times
larger than the database disk in order to hold 10 rotating backups.

<h3><a name="1.2">1.2 Networking</a></h3>

Easotope listens on a TCP socket for connections from clients. This requires that any
firewalls on the network be configured to allow connections to reach the server from any
machine where a user will want to run the client. Depending on the operating system your
server is using, you may also need to configure the computer's firewall to allow incoming
connections.

<h2><a name="2.0">2.0 Distribution Structure</a></h2>

<p>The top level directory for the Easotope server distribution is named easotope_server
and it contains the following items:</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>docs</td>
    <td>Holds documentation such as this file and license information.</td>
  </tr>
 
  <tr>
    <td>logs</td>
    <td>Holds log files created by the server while it is running. Inside
        this directory, files with names beginning with log_ are created by
        Easotope directly and files with names
        starting with orm_log_ are created by the database libraries</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>repository</td>
    <td>Created by the Eclipse infrastructure and should be ignored.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>win32.win32.x86<br>linux.gtk.x86_64</td>
    <td>Holds the compiled libraries and the executable.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>args.properties</td>
    <td>Configuration file for the server. This is the only file you should
        need to edit.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>logs.zip</td>
    <td>Created by the Eclipse infrastructure and should be ignored.</td>
  </tr>
 
  <tr>
    <td>README.txt</td>
    <td>Points to the server documentation.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>topdir.txt</td>
    <td>A marker that Easotope uses to find the top level directory of the
        distribution tree.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="3.0">3.0 Configuration</a></h2>

<p>All configuration information is saved in the file <i>args.properties</i> and this is the
only file you should need to edit. This file is a Java properties file which is a normal
text file that can be edited with any text editor. Note that Java properties files
use a # to indicate that the rest of the line is a comment. So you will need to remove the #
at the beginning any lines that you configure. Also note that Windows directory paths must
contain double backslashes as in this example: C:\\Users\\admin\\Desktop\\easotope_database</p>

<p>There are two parameters that are required to be set before running a server:</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>dbdir</td>
    <td>The full path to the directory where the database
         will be created. The specified directory should already exist
         and be empty before running the server.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>port</td>
    <td>The TCP socket that the server will listen to for incoming
        client connections. Socket number 55000 is often used for Easotope
        servers but there is no specific reason for this. You can choose
        whatever your firewalls allow.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In addition to these, there are a few other optional parameters that you may set to
enable additional functionality on the server:</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>backupdir</td>
    <td>The full path to the directory where the database
        backups are stored. As backups are made, zip files will be added
        to this directory. The specified directory should already exist
        and be empty before running the server.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>backuptimes</td>
    <td>This parameter is required if the <i>backupdir</i> parameter is
	set. It is a comma separated list of times of the day (in the local
	time zone and 24-hour time format) when backups should be made.
	For example, setting this value to 0200,1400 will cause backups to
	be made at 2 o'clock in the morning and 2 o'clock in the afternoon
	every day. Backups during working hours should be avoided, however,
	because the server will not answer client requests while making
	backups.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>maxbackups</td>
    <td>This is the number of backup zip files that should be left
	in <i>backupdir</i> before old backups are removed. It is highly
	recommended that this value be set to avoid running out of
	disk space.</td>
  </tr>
 
  <tr> 
    <td>debug</td>
    <td>If set to <i>true</i>, this will enable verbose logging.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  	<td>reparseAcquisitions</td>
  	<td>If set to <i>true</i>, the server will reparse all acquisition
  	files whenever it starts. This could take a very long time, so this
  	option should not normally be used. It is only useful in very rare
  	cases.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="4.0">4.0 Running the Server</a></h2>

<p>After the <i>args.properties</i> file has been configured and the <i>dbdir</i>
and (optionally) <i>backupdir</i> directories have been created, you can start the server
by running the executable. On Windows this can be found in:</p>

<p>win32.win32.x86\eclipse\easotope.exe</p>

<p>And on Linux in:</p>

<p>linux.gtk.x86_64/eclipse/easotope</p>

<p>After running the executable, there will be no graphical indication that a server
is running. No window appears on the screen and it may appear as if nothing happened.
This is because the server runs as an invisible background process. There are three
ways to verify that the server is running:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look to see that the process is running by using the Task Manager (Windows) or
  the "ps" command (Linux).</li>

  <li>Read the most recent log file in the server's log folder. If the file ends with
  the message "Connected" then the server is running and awaiting client requests.</li>

  <li>Try connecting with an Easotope client.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that if you are trying to connect to a server with a client running on the same
machine, you can use the hostname "localhost" which is an internet standard alias meaning
"this computer".)</p>

<p>Once you have things running, you will probably want to configure your operating system
to automatically start a server on reboot.</p>

<h2><a name="5.0">5.0 Upgrading the Server</a></h2>

<p>IMPORTANT: Before upgrading a server ALWAYS make a backup copy of your database
folder so that you can revert to it if there are problems. It is also wise to keep this
backup for a few days in case there are problems that are not immediately obvious.</p>

<p>Upgrading a previously installed server to a new version of Easotope is very easy. Simply
stop the old server, copy the <i>args.properties</i> file from the old server to the new,
and start the new server.</p>

<p>The first time a new version of a server is run, the server will make
any necessary modifications to the database. If the modifications are significant, it might
also decide to rebuild some of the dynamic database tables. This whole process can last
from a few seconds to many minutes. During this time period, the server will allow clients
to connect but it will not process any requests from them until the tables are rebuilt. If
this process fails for some reason, you can find more information about the failure in
the server's log file.</p>
